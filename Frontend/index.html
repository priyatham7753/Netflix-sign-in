    On 6 and 9 August 1945, the United States detonated two atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively.
    The bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in 
    an armed conflict. Japan surrendered to the Allies on 15 August, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration 
    of war against Japan and invasion of Japanese-occupied Manchuria. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on 2 September, 
    effectively ending the war.

  <h3>
    Pacific War
  </h3>

  <p style="font-size: 18px;">

    In the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. This undertaking was preceded by a 
    conventional bombing and firebombing campaign that devastated 64 Japanese cities. The war in the European theatre concluded when Germany 
    surrendered on 8 May 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific War. By July 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had 
    produced two types of atomic bombs: "Little Boy", an enriched uranium gun-type fission weapon, and "Fat Man", a plutonium implosion-type 
    nuclear weapon. The 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces was trained and equipped with the specialized Silverplate 
    version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and deployed to Tinian in the Mariana Islands. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender 
    of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, the alternative being "prompt and utter destruction". 
    The Japanese government ignored the ultimatum.

  <h3>
    Preparations to invade Japan
  </h3>

  <p style="font-size: 18px;">

    Even before the surrender of Nazi Germany on 8 May 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, 
    the Allied invasion of Japan. The operation had two parts: set to begin in October 1945, Operation Olympic involved a series of landings 
    by the U.S. Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū.This was to be followed 
    in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honshū by the U.S. First, Eighth 
    and Tenth Armies, as well as a Commonwealth Corps made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions. The target date was chosen to allow 
    for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass.

    Japan's geography made this invasion plan obvious to the Japanese; they were able to predict the Allied invasion plans accurately and thus 
    adjust their defensive plan, Operation Ketsugō, accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū, with little left in reserve.
    In all, there were 2.3 million Japanese Army troops prepared to defend the home islands, backed by a civilian militia of 28 million. Casualty 
    predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. The Vice Chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, Vice Admiral Takijirō Ōnishi, 
    predicted up to 20 million Japanese deaths.

    The Americans were alarmed by the Japanese buildup, which was accurately tracked through Ultra intelligence.On 15 June 1945, a study by the 
    Joint War Plans Committee,drawing on the experience of the Battle of Leyte, estimated that Downfall would result in 132,500 to 
    220,000 U.S. casualties, with U.S. dead and missing in the range from 27,500 to 50,000. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson commissioned
     his own study by Quincy Wright and William Shockley, who estimated the invading Allies would suffer between 1.7 and 4 million casualties, of 
    whom between 400,000 and 800,000 would be dead, while Japanese fatalities would have been around 5 to 10 million.In a meeting with 
    the President and commanders on June 18, 1945, Gen. Marshall stated that "there was reason to believe" casualties for the first 30 days would 
    not exceed the price paid for Luzon. Additionally, with the Japanese position rendered "hopeless" by an invasion of their mainland, Marshall 
    speculated that Soviet entry into the war might be "the decisive action" needed to finally "[leverage] them into capitulation."

  <h3>
    Air raids on Japan

    While the United States had developed plans for an air campaign against Japan prior to the Pacific War, the capture of Allied bases in 
    the western Pacific in the first weeks of the conflict meant that this offensive did not begin until mid-1944 when the long-ranged Boeing 
    B-29 Superfortress became ready for use in combat.Operation Matterhorn involved India-based B-29s staging through bases around Chengdu 
    in China to make a series of raids on strategic targets in Japan.This effort failed to achieve the strategic objectives that its 
    planners had intended, largely because of logistical problems, the bomber's mechanical difficulties, the vulnerability of Chinese staging 
    bases, and the extreme range required to reach key Japanese cities.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 18px;">
    Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell determined that Guam, Tinian, and Saipan in the Mariana Islands would better serve as B-29 bases, but 
    they were in Japanese hands.Strategies were shifted to accommodate the air war, and the islands were captured between June and 
    August 1944. Air bases were developed, and B-29 operations commenced from the Marianas in October 1944. The XXI Bomber Command 
    began missions against Japan on 18 November 1944. The early attempts to bomb Japan from the Marianas proved just as ineffective as 
    the China-based B-29s had been. Hansell continued the practice of conducting so-called high-altitude precision bombing, aimed at key 
    industries and transportation networks, even after these tactics had not produced acceptable results. These efforts proved unsuccessful 
    due to logistical difficulties with the remote location, technical problems with the new and advanced aircraft, unfavorable weather conditions, 
    and enemy action.
